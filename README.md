## I believe software applications can provide low-cost/highly-scalable solutions to real world problems. 

Wether helping us manage our day-to-day, or helping us reach our financial or health goals, to helping us analyze complex genetic data to help enhance our understanding of inherited diseases. Well though-out software can help-us implement equitable solutions.

✨Fun fact: I have nearly a decade of experience working in Social Services where I managed an office and a team of 23 individuals. Learning to be an effective manager provided the best opportunity for me learn more, not just about those who I managed, but also of myself.
